        <p>Information Security Response Team Nepal (NPCERT) will be hosting a <strong>Global Cyber Security Summit (GCSS) 2018</strong> on July 27 and 28 with the theme <i>"Building Global Alliance for Cyber Resilience"</i>. The objective of the summit is to provide a creative and productive platform for professionals in the field of Cybersecurity. The summit will empower new generation and will bring together different related stakeholders, with an eye to reflect nitty-gritty of how to transfer, diffuse and combat Cyber threats with their mitigation plans ensuring Cyberlaw putting in place.</p>
        <p>There is no gainsaying that the security status of cyberworld in Nepal is very critical. Websites of various private and public websites of the different organization are being hacked, the large-scale financial attacks, social media related cyber crimes like fake profile marketing and cyber heist are all consequences of a weak security posture that are publicly visible. But, these are only a small part of the overall security statistics. Many poor configurations that result in these visible impacts go unnoticed until it leads to the worst outcome. </p>
        <p>Primary target audiences of the summit are IT professionals, security experts, government employees, enterprise businessmen, students from different sectors, banking sector personnel and other members interested to the topic. Participants will get ample time to share experiences and challenges with regard to Cybersecurity in their respective countries, along with two days of intense engagement on technology and security related issues. The summit is an initiative to make people aware of information security in order to establish a strong security posture in Nepal. </p>
        <p>The summit will be structured to include a day of presentations, panel discussions, and keynote lectures followed by workshops. Participants can interact with national and international business partners, employers, clients and customers. </p>
        <p>NPCERT invites researchers from around the world to submit abstracts for presentation at our GCSS 2018 on the topics <a href="https://www.npcert.org/callforpaper.html" style="color:#f75511; font-weight: bold;">here</a>. Abstracts will be peer reviewed and Acceptance will be based on content, available space, and overall program balance. Oral and poster presentations will take place on July 27 and 28, 2018.</p>
        <p>NPCERT is a team of Information Security experts formed to address the urgent need for the protection of national information and growing cybersecurity threat in Nepal. The attack on information infrastructures are increasing in frequency and scale so, to address all these issues NPCERT was established. </p>
